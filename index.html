			About Solar System
		</h2>
		<div class="solar">
			<p>
				The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. It formed 4.6
				billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority
				(99.86%) of the system's mass is in the Sun, with most of the remaining mass contained in the planet Jupiter.

				<h3>
					Inner planets
				</h3>
				<p>
					The inner Solar System is the region comprising the terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. Composed mainly
					of silicates and metals, the objects of the inner Solar System are relatively close to the Sun; the radius of
					this entire region is less than the distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. This region is also
					within the frost line, which is a little less than 5 AU (750 million km; 460 million mi) from the Sun
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="desc-right">
				<h3>
					Outer planets
				</h3>
				<p>
					The four outer planets, also called giant planets or Jovian planets, collectively make up 99% of the mass
					known to orbit the Sun. Jupiter and Saturn are together more than 400 times the mass of Earth and consist
					overwhelmingly of the gases hydrogen and helium, hence their designation as gas giants. Uranus and Neptune are
					far less massive—less than 20 Earth masses (MEarth) each—and are composed primarily of ices.
					The ring–moon systems of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus are like miniature versions of the Solar System; that of
					Neptune is significantly different, having been disrupted by the capture of its largest moon Triton.

				<li>
					<a href="img2/mercury.png">
						Mercury
					</a>
					<p>
						Mercury (0.4 AU (60 million km; 37 million mi) from the Sun) is the closest planet to the Sun. The smallest
						planet in the Solar System (0.055 MEarth), Mercury has no natural satellites. The dominant geological
						features are impact craters or basins with ejecta blankets, the remains of early volcanic activity including
						magma flows, and lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a period of contraction early in the
						planet's history.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="img2/venus.jpg">
						Venus
					</a>
					<p>
						Venus (0.7 AU (100 million km; 65 million mi) from the Sun) is close in size to Earth (0.815 MEarth) and,
						like Earth, has a thick silicate mantle around an iron core, a substantial atmosphere, and evidence of
						internal geological activity. It is much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense.
						Venus has no natural satellites. It is the hottest planet, with surface temperatures over 400 °C (752 °F),
						mainly due to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="img2/earth.jpg">
						Earth
					</a>
					<p>
						Earth (1 AU (150 million km; 93 million mi) from the Sun) is the largest and densest of the inner planets,
						the only one known to have current geological activity, and the only place where life is known to exist.[99]
						Its liquid hydrosphere is unique among the terrestrial planets, and it is the only planet where plate
						tectonics has been observed. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="img2/mars.jpg">
						Mars
					</a>
					<p>
						Mars (1.5 AU (220 million km; 140 million mi) from the Sun) is smaller than Earth and Venus (0.107 MEarth).
						It has an atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide with a surface pressure of 6.1 millibars (0.088 psi; 0.18
						inHg); roughly 0.6% of that of Earth but sufficient to support weather phenomena. Its surface, peppered with
						volcanoes, such as Olympus Mons, and rift valleys, such as Valles Marineris, shows geological activity that
						may have persisted until as recently as 2 million years ago.[105] Its red colour comes from iron oxide
						(rust) in its soil.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="img2/jupiter.jpg">
						Jupiter
					</a>
					<p>
						Jupiter (5.2 AU (780 million km; 480 million mi) from the Sun), at 318 MEarth, is 2.5 times the mass of all
						the other planets put together. It is composed largely of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter's strong internal
						heat creates semi-permanent features in its atmosphere, such as cloud bands and the Great Red Spot. The
						planet possesses a 4.2–14 Gauss strength magnetosphere that spans 22–29 million km, making it, in certain
						respects, the largest object in the Solar System.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="img2/saturn.jpg">
						Saturn
					</a>
					<p>
						Saturn (9.5 AU (1.42 billion km; 880 million mi) from the Sun), distinguished by its extensive ring system,
						has several similarities to Jupiter, such as its atmospheric composition and magnetosphere. Although Saturn
						has 60% of Jupiter's volume, it is less than a third as massive, at 95 MEarth. Saturn is the only planet of
						the Solar System that is less dense than water. The rings of Saturn are made up of small ice and rock
						particles. Saturn has 83 confirmed satellites composed largely of ice.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="img2/uran.jpg">
						Uranus
					</a>
					<p>
						Uranus (19.2 AU (2.87 billion km; 1.78 billion mi) from the Sun), at 14 MEarth, has the lowest mass of the
						outer planets. Uniquely among the planets, it orbits the Sun on its side; its axial tilt is over ninety
						degrees to the ecliptic. This gives the planet extreme seasonal variation as each pole points toward and
						then away from the Sun.[136] It has a much colder core than the other giant planets and radiates very little
						heat into space.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="img2/nept.jpg">
						Neptune
					</a>
					<p>
						Neptune (30.1 AU (4.50 billion km; 2.80 billion mi) from the Sun), though slightly smaller than Uranus, is
						more massive (17 MEarth) and hence more dense. It radiates more internal heat than Uranus, but not as much
						as Jupiter or Saturn. Neptune has 14 known satellites. The largest, Triton, is geologically active, with
						geysers of liquid nitrogen. Triton is the only large satellite with a retrograde orbit, which indicates that
						it did not form with Neptune, but was probably captured from the Kuiper belt. Neptune is accompanied in its
						orbit by several minor planets, termed Neptune trojans, that either lead or trail the planet by about
						one-sixth of the way around the Sun, positions known as Lagrange points.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="img2/pluto.jpg">
						Pluto
					</a>
					<p>
						The dwarf planet Pluto (with an average orbit of 39 AU (5.8 billion km; 3.6 billion mi) from the Sun) is the
						largest known object in the Kuiper belt. When discovered in 1930, it was considered to be the ninth planet;
						this changed in 2006 with the adoption of a formal definition of planet. Pluto has a relatively eccentric
						orbit inclined 17 degrees to the ecliptic plane and ranging from 29.7 AU (4.44 billion km; 2.76 billion mi)
						from the Sun at perihelion (within the orbit of Neptune) to 49.5 AU (7.41 billion km; 4.60 billion mi) at
						aphelion.
